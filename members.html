              I loved growing up in a very small town in Idaho, where everyone knows everyone and neighbors are family. Iâ€™m the oldest of four kids and grew up busy with sports, music, and great friends! My dad worked at BYUI (finally retired this year) and my mom was an RN who worked nights while us kids were young, and eventually she became a nurse practitioner. 



I peaked in high school- with the very best friends in the universe, but that pattern has continued throughout my life. Iâ€™ve always been surrounded by great people. In college, I studied political science and genetics, and though I loved interning for political campaigns and working for senators through college, after I graduated BYU, I became a drug rep for in Arizona. At that point in time, Kingston and I were just friends, but as soon as I moved out of Provo, he knew he couldnâ€™t live without me and finally made a move. ðŸ˜‰ I was already hooked, he had me almost from day 1 (although my roommate liked him and I liked his roommate initiallyâ€” and now theyâ€™re married with 5 kids too!) We got married in the Idaho Falls Temple in spite of my quirks of losing everything and his extreme dry sense of humor. Sarcasm flows but so does his big heart!



He started and ran his first company in San Antonio, Texas and after we sold that after a year of being married, he and I moved to Salt Lake City for him to attend law school, and after another drug rep territory change for me I started my MBA at the University of Utah. (We bleed blue but cheer for the Uteâ€™s when they arenâ€™t playing Cougars.)



I had Knox (our first kiddo of what would become five) after my first year in business school and then after graduation I started a consulting business doing mostly marketing strategy and eventually websites and ad campaigns. As we were blessed with more children, I have slowed that part of my life. Somehow the calendar is always full!



Kingston worked as in-house council for a while after law school, but we got an opportunity to move to Florida approximately 10 years ago. We werenâ€™t expecting to be here this long, but we have fallen in love with our Ward, the people in Florida, and the beach. 



Kingston works in private equity and loves to buy, sell, and grow businesses. He runs a few businesses here in Florida, and manages businesses in France, Missouri, Texas, and most recently New Mexico. His background has curated an unmatched level of discretion and confidentiality. His superpower is not getting flustered and seeing the best in people: His kryptonite is remembering which flight is and when with time changes. He does not stress about that kind of thing but I do! ðŸ˜‚



Our five kids keep me busy most evenings and every weekend- a few play travel sports and all of them play multiple sports for different leagues. I love to coach them when I can! They all play the piano and are into music. Knox is in the teachers quorum and our youngest is 2 and soooo very silly and active. We have one daughter who loves all things sparkly and all of our boys love food, especially sushi! I am looking forward to getting to know everyone in our new website.
